Final Boss Medley I made back in 2022. 

Sorta gives you an idea of the rabbit hole that is the Touhou danmaku fangames / fake fangame album scene.

I submitted this set to the mse discord's Field Test season 7!

I also recorded all my games during field test. It's not very watchable though because it suffers from all the standard "Ricky stutters a lot and sucks at commentary" problems. I think I'm mostly recording for archival purposes anyways.
